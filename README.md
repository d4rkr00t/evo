## TODO

- [ ] Cache Improvements
  - [ ] Tasks cache should not depend on other tasks in the workspace
  - [ ] Workspace cache should only depend on the cache of the outputs of its dependencies
- [ ] Support yarn
- [ ] Support npm
- [ ] Support custom package manager (?)
- [ ] Cache diagnostics
  - [ ] List of files that were used to create hash
  - [ ] Diff to show what affected cache
- [ ] Watchman integration and persistent graph
- [ ] Fix that – Didn't produce outputs still caches and doesn't fail next time
- [ ] Clean up only once before any of the tasks run (?)
  - [ ] Might have to restore all of the other outputs
  - [ ] Maybe make it manual?
    - [ ] Otherwise need to hash contents of output
- [ ] REFACTOR: Workspaces map to use the DAG library
- [ ] REFACTOR: create tasks from workspaces
  - [ ] REFACTOR: Generic create task from a rule
- [ ] REFACTOR: Refactor cache to interfaces
- [ ] REFACTOR: Refactor logger
  - [ ] to interfaces
  - [x] Cleaner API
  - [ ] Add debug level to the logger
- [ ] Improve unknown dependency error message
- [ ] SANDBOXING !!!
- [ ] Rules
  - [ ] check that command exist
  - [ ] check all required fields
    - [ ] provide schema (?)
- [ ] Different info
  - [x] Show what's included in hash for a workspace – `evo show-hash pkg-a`
  - [x] Show all rules for a WS with overrides – `evo show-rules pkg-a`
  - [ ] Why a package is affected – `evo why pkg-a`
- [ ] Make sure target outputs exist
  - [x] After task run
  - [ ] On package invalidate – [if not invalidated restore outputs]
- [ ] More commands
  - [x] `evo show-scope <package>` – show what packages are in scope
  - [ ] `evo add dep@ver` to add a dependency
  - [ ] `evo remove dep` to remove a dependency
  - [ ] `evo clear-cache <package>`
  - [ ] `evo clear-output <package>` – clears all outputs from packages
  - [ ] `evo import`
    - [ ] makes sure that all dependencies are on expected versions
    - [ ] makes sure that all dependencies are lifted to the top level package.json
- [ ] Put overrides to file system
- [ ] Use .gitignore in addition to include/exclude in evo config
- [ ] Remote cache
- [ ] Watch mode
- [ ] FileSystem
  - [ ] Cache file check-sums
  - [ ] Update file check sums only when modified time is after previous update
  - [ ] Watch file changes during task run
    - [ ] Update FileSystem cache only when a file changes
- [ ] Explore not managing dependencies for workspaces
  - [ ] Let yarn/pnpm/npm manage dependencies for workspaces, drop custom linking logic
- [ ] Generators / Templates
  - [ ] Generate a project from pnpm/yarn workspace and npm scripts
- [ ] `--force` to force run a command, ignoring cache (?)
- [ ] Use semver comparison for dependencies (?)
- [ ] Website
  - [ ] Documentation
- [ ] REFACTOR: Go Generics
- [ ] https://github.com/adrg/xdg
- [ ] https://github.com/karrick/godirwalk
- [ ] https://github.com/sabhiram/go-gitignore (?)
