## TODO

- [ ] Stop swallowing stderr or stdout in case of an error
- [ ] Rewrite show-affected to use :: syntax for targets and workspaces
- [ ] Cache improvements
  - [ ] Custom Hash Input for e.g. environment, etc...
  - [ ] Remote cache (MVP)
  - [ ] Cache rotation – e.g. `evo clear-cache` clears stale cache
  - [ ] `evo clear-cache <package>`
  - [ ] `evo clear-output <package>` – clears all outputs from packages
- [ ] FileSystem
  - [ ] Cache file check-sums
  - [ ] Update file check sums only when modified time is after previous update
  - [ ] Watch file changes during task run
    - [ ] Update FileSystem cache only when a file changes

    - [ ] Show some stats info about the repo
- [ ] Reporter
  - [ ] Spinner disappears
  - [ ] Useless when a lot of tasks
    - [ ] Show only top level and failed. In spinner report progress with – succeeded (+from cache) / failed (+from cache)
  - [ ] On error need to report status – succeeded (+from cache) / failed (+from cache)
  - [ ] Move reporter locking into a separate go routine
- [ ] Tests

- [ ] SANDBOXING !!!
- [ ] Targets
  - [ ] check that command exist
  - [ ] check all required fields
    - [ ] provide schema (?)
- [ ] Different info
  - [x] Show what's included in hash for a workspace – `evo show-hash pkg-a`
  - [x] Show all rules for a WS with overrides – `evo show-rules pkg-a`
  - [ ] Why a package is affected – `evo why pkg-a`
- [ ] More commands
  - [x] `evo show-scope <package>` – show what packages are in scope
  - [ ] `evo import`
    - [ ] makes sure that all dependencies are on expected versions
    - [ ] makes sure that all dependencies are lifted to the top level package.json
- [ ] Use .gitignore in addition to include/exclude in evo config
- [ ] Generators / Templates
  - [ ] Generate a project from pnpm/yarn workspace and npm scripts
- [ ] Use semver comparison for dependencies (?)
- [ ] Task Shell Like commands:
    - [ ] https://github.com/denoland/deno_task_shell
    - [ ] https://deno.land/manual/tools/task_runner#built-in-commands
- [ ] https://github.com/karrick/godirwalk
