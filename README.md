- [ ] SANDBOXING !!!
- [ ] Rules
  - [ ] check that command exist

- [ ] Different info
  - [x] Show what's included in hash for a workspace – `evo show-hash pkg-a`
  - [x] Show all rules for a WS with overrides – `evo show-rules pkg-a`
  - [ ] Why a package is affected – `evo why pkg-a`
- [ ] Make sure target outputs exist
  - [x] After task run
  - [ ] On package invalidate – [if not invalidated restore outputs]
- [ ] More commands
  - [x] `evo show-scope <package>` – show what packages are in scope
  - [ ] `evo add dep@ver` to add a dependency
  - [ ] `evo remove dep` to remove a dependency
  - [ ] `evo import`
    - [ ] makes sure that all dependencies are on expected versions
    - [ ] makes sure that all dependencies are lifted to the top level package.json
- [ ] Put overrides to file system
- [ ] Use .gitignore in addition to include/exclude in evo config
- [ ] FileSystem
  - [ ] Cache file check-sums
  - [ ] Update file check sums only when modified time is after previous update
  - [ ] Watch file changes during task run
    - [ ] Update FileSystem cache only when a file changes
- [ ] Explore not managing dependencies for workspaces
  - [ ] Let yarn/pnpm/npm manage dependencies for workspaces, drop custom linking logic
- [ ] Generators / Templates
  - [ ] Generate a project from pnpm/yarn workspace and npm scripts
- [ ] Use semver comparison for dependencies (?)
- [ ] https://github.com/adrg/xdg
- [ ] https://github.com/karrick/godirwalk
- [ ] https://github.com/sabhiram/go-gitignore (?)
